    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>I am 24 years old, almost two years ago I graduated from the BSU Faculty of History. From that moment I work as an archivist. More than six months ago, I decided that I was acutely lacking new knowledge, I wanted to learn something useful for myself. I chose to study web technologies, mainly because I always wanted to understand how it works from the inside and wanted build web-cites on my own.</p>
    <p>Now I am very highly motivated to acquire new knowledge and new profession of a web developer. I try to devote time to self-study and practice every day and now I think I know much more, than I knew at the beginning of my path of web-developer. But at the same time, I understand how much more I still have to study, and I am <strong>very excited</strong>  about it.</p>
    <p>The acquisition of knowledge, skills and, at the end <i>(and start, i hope)</i>, the profession - that is the goal that stands before me now.</p>

  <section class="skills" id="skills">
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML5, CSS3</li>
      <li>Less, SCSS</li>
      <li>Git, Gulp, Photoshop</li>
      <li>Basic knowledge in JavaScript(ES6)</li>
      <li>Basic knowledge in React</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In general, I think that I have a basic knowledge of web technologies and the basics of javascript, but so far I don`t have enough practice of applying them.</p>
