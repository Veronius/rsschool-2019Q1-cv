## Summary
### My goals and wishes
## Skills
## Education
I do not have a profile progamming or computer science education, but I make efforts to study web and programming for more than half a year. For the most part, this is self-study. 

I take online courses on web technologies, markup languages, programming on various platforms: _freecodecamp.org, codecademy.com, htmlacademy.ru, learn.javascript.ru,_ etc. Every day I try to spend time studying web technologies, read profile articles, watch videos, listen to podcasts.

Currently i am studying at **Rolling Scopes school**.
