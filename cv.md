## Summary
I am 24 years old, almost two years ago I graduated from the BSU Faculty of History. From that moment I work as an archivist. More than six months ago, I decided that I was acutely lacking new knowledge, I wanted to learn something useful for myself. I chose to study web technologies, mainly because I always wanted to understand how it works from the inside and wanted build web-cites on my own.

Now I am very highly motivated to acquire new knowledge and new profession of a web developer. I try to devote time to self-study and practice every day and now I think I know much more, than I knew at the beginning of my path of web-developer. But at the same time, I understand how much more I still have to study, and I am **very excited** about it. 

The acquisition of knowledge, skills and, at the end _(and start, i hope)_, the profession - that is the goal that stands before me now.

## Skills
 - HTML5, CSS3
 - Less, SCSS
 - Git, Gulp, Photoshop
 - Basic knowledge in JavaScript(ES6) 
 - Basic knowledge in React 
 
 In general, I think that I have a basic knowledge of web technologies and the basics of javascript, but so far I don`t have enough practice of applying them.
## Education
I don`t have a profile programming or computer science education, but I make efforts to study web and programming for more than half a year. For the most part, this is self-study. 

I take online courses on web technologies, markup languages, programming on various platforms: _freecodecamp.org, codecademy.com, htmlacademy.ru, learn.javascript.ru,_ etc. Every day I try to spend time studying web technologies, read profile articles, watch videos, listen to podcasts.

Currently i am studying at **Rolling Scopes school**.
## English level
My English level is about Intermediate (B1). I studied English at university a couple of years ago. Now I am constantly practicing English, watch videos and films in English, read profile articles on _web technologies and programming_, economics and history. I also listen to English-language podcasts, read books, etc.
