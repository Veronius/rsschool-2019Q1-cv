## Summary
### My goals and wishes

 In general, I think that I have a basic knowledge of web technologies and the basics of javascript, but so far I don`t have enough practice of applying them.
## Education
I don`t have a profile programming or computer science education, but I make efforts to study web and programming for more than half a year. For the most part, this is self-study. 

I take online courses on web technologies, markup languages, programming on various platforms: _freecodecamp.org, codecademy.com, htmlacademy.ru, learn.javascript.ru,_ etc. Every day I try to spend time studying web technologies, read profile articles, watch videos, listen to podcasts.

Currently i am studying at **Rolling Scopes school**.
## English level
My English level is about Intermediate (B1). I studied English at university a couple of years ago. Now I am constantly practicing English, watch videos and films in English, read profile articles on _web technologies and programming_, economics and history. I also listen to English-language podcasts, read books, etc.
